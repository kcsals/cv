      <h3>Nerd Stuff</h3>
      <p>
        My Favorite <em><strong>nerd</strong></em> hobbies include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Coding. No really...</li>
        <li>
          Love Harry Potter, Star Wars, and Halo. I also have strong opinions on
          different media of each of those IPs. My favorite Youtuber on all
          these IPs is
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/EckhartsLadder/featured"
            >EckhartsLadder</a
          >. His channel is dedicated to all three of these IPs.

          I like Gaming, but not comptetively. I like more story based games.
